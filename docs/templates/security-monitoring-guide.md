## üîç Security Monitoring Components

### 1. Log Collection Sources
- Palo Alto NGFW
  ```
  - Threat logs
  - Traffic logs
  - System logs
  - Configuration logs
  ```

- VPN Monitoring
  ```
  - Connection status
  - Authentication logs
  - Bandwidth usage
  - Split tunneling events
  ```

- Network Access Control
  ```
  - Authentication events
  - Policy violations
  - Device compliance
  - Access attempts
  ```

### 2. Security Alert Configuration
```yaml
# security_alerts.yml
rules:
  - name: "Brute Force Detection"
    condition:
      timeframe: 5m
      threshold: 10
      event: "Authentication Failure"
    severity: High
    action: 
      - notify_security_team
      - block_source_ip

  - name: "Malware Detection"
    condition:
      event: "Threat Detection"
      threat_level: "Critical"
    severity: Critical
    action:
      - isolate_host
      - notify_security_team
      - create_incident
```

## üö® Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Security Incident Levels
```
Level 1 (Low):
- Minor policy violations
- Single failed login attempts
- Non-critical system alerts

Level 2 (Medium):
- Multiple failed logins
- Suspicious traffic patterns
- Policy violations

Level 3 (High):
- Confirmed malware
- Data breach attempts
- DDoS attacks

Level 4 (Critical):
- Active breach
- Data exfiltration
- System compromise
```

### 2. Response Workflow

    B -->|Medium| D[Initial Investigation]
    B -->|High| E[Immediate Response]
    B -->|Critical| F[Emergency Response]
    
    D --> G[Analyze & Contain]
    E --> H[Isolate & Mitigate]
    F --> I[Crisis Management]
```

## üìä Security Dashboards

### 1. Security Overview Dashboard

```

### 2. Compliance Monitoring
```yaml
compliance_checks:
  - name: "Firewall Policy Audit"
    frequency: Daily
    checks:
      - policy_consistency
      - rule_optimization
      - unused_rules
      - risky_configurations

  - name: "Access Control Review"
    frequency: Weekly
    checks:
      - privilege_review
      - account_status
      - password_policy
      - access_patterns
```

## üîÑ Security Monitoring Workflow

### 1. Real-time Monitoring
```
1. Data Collection
   [ ] Log aggregation
   [ ] Event correlation
   [ ] Real-time analysis
   [ ] Threat intelligence

2. Analysis
   [ ] Pattern recognition
   [ ] Anomaly detection
   [ ] Behavior analysis
   [ ] Context enrichment

3. Response
   [ ] Alert generation
   [ ] Incident creation
   [ ] Automated response
   [ ] Team notification
```

### 2. Periodic Assessment
```
Daily Tasks:
[ ] Review critical alerts
[ ] Check security logs
[ ] Monitor active threats
[ ] Verify system health

Weekly Tasks:
[ ] Security report review
[ ] Threat hunting
[ ] Policy compliance check
[ ] Performance analysis

Monthly Tasks:
[ ] Security assessment
[ ] Policy review
[ ] System updates
[ ] Threat landscape review
```

   - Detection Coverage
   - Alert Accuracy

2. Response Metrics
   - Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
   - Incident Resolution Time
   - Response Effectiveness
   - Recovery Time
```

### 2. Reporting Templates
```

- Critical Incidents: [Count]
- Active Threats: [List]
- Policy Violations: [Summary]
- System Health: [Status]

Weekly Security Summary:
- Incident Trends
